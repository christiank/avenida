BUILDING AVENIDA

==========

Building Avenida is fairly straightforward. First you need to build Lua,
whose code Avenida ships:

    $ pwd
    avenida
    $ cd src/lua/src
    $ make macosx   # or whatever platform you're running

Then you need to build Avenida itself. Note that Avenida's Makefile requires
BSD make (aka bmake).

    $ pwd
    avenida/src/lua/src
    $ cd ../..
    $ bmake all
