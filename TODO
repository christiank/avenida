- "keyword arguments" instead of just positional ones -- should make
  avnscript far more readable

- the interpreter really shouldn't be lua(1); build avenida(1) which will
  make certain tables available and global (raster or whatever)

- operations on 2 or more avnrasters -- how to do this?

- there's nothing preventing the user from calling render() twice -- suggest
  a private flag that gets raised when render is called the first time?

- need to handle in case there are too many operations for a media artifact

- need to handle in case there are too many args to an operation

- figure out what's wrong with raster_radialblur

- lua interface for "info" needs to return a table with everything in it

- need to properly namespace the Lua modules -- one .so per species, and
  then another for utils?

- support for remote files :) that's the whole point of JSON serialization

- spidermonkey, mruby, cython, ... squirrel (haha)

- need an enumeration for vector line caps

- write a man page
