<p><strong>Avenida</strong> is a multimedia scripting runtime environment. It
is a suite of tools which allow for rapid prototyping of digital media
operations.<jp>


<h2>What's Included</h2>

<ul>
  <li>The <code>avenida</code> command line interpreter</li>
</ul>


<h2>System Requirements</h2>

<ul>
  <li>GraphicsMagick</li>
  <li>BSD Make</li>
  <li>A C11 compiler (anything with support for anonymous unions) &mdash; Clang
  is fine</li>
</ul>


<h2>Avnscript Reference</h2>

<p>Avnscript is a miniature programming language geared towards multimedia. It
actually is nothing but a tricked-out <a href="http://www.lua.org">Lua</a>
interpreter with capabilities to query and manipulate multimedia files.
Performing batch operations on digital media files with Avnscript is simple and
straightforward.</p>


<h3>Media Species</h3>

<p>To avoid ambiguities with terms such as "format," Avnscript uses a different
set of terms.</p>

<p>Avenida recognizes four <em>media species</em>: <strong>raster
graphics</strong>, <strong>vector graphics</strong>, <strong>audio</strong>,
and <strong>video</strong>. (To be perfectly clear, "video" has no sound, by
definition. It's just video.)</p>


<h2>How it Works</h2>

<p>When you invoke a media operation, you're not actually <em>applying</em>
that operation onto the media. Instead, Avenida makes a note of what
<em>would</em> happen. Operations are not actually applied until you call the
render() function.</p>

<p>This gives the interpreter the opportunity to verify problems. In a future
release, the interpreter will also take this opportunity to strategize and find
the fastest way to get the result based on the operations in the list.</p>
